Discussion Guidance:

1. Interpretation:
- Do the results match theoretical expectations? (e.g., Does $mu_r$ approach 1 at saturation?)
- Discuss the shape of the loops.
2. Comparison:
- Compare your results with literature values (cite references).
- Compare the materials (Steel vs Iron vs Cu/Ni).
3. Uncertainties:
- Critical evaluation of Systematic and Random errors.
- Discuss the limitations of the apparatus (e.g., temperature measurement accuracy for Cu/Ni).
- How do uncertainties affect your conclusions?
