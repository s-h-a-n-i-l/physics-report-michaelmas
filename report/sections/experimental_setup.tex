Experimental Setup Guidance:

1. General:
- Do NOT rewrite the lab manual step-by-step.
- Focus on what is relevant for the reader to understand the results.
2. Apparatus:
- Include a schematic diagram of the setup (Solenoid, Secondary coil, Integrator, Oscilloscope).
- Describe the integrator circuit (R and C values) and why it's used.
- Mention the calibration step using the air core (linear B-H).
3. Samples:
- List the materials tested: Mild steel, Transformer iron, Cu/Ni alloy.
- Mention the temperature variation setup for Cu/Ni.
