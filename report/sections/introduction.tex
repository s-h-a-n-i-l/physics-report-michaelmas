Introduction Guidance:

1. Context & Motivation:
- Why is this experiment interesting? (e.g., understanding magnetic properties of materials).
- Explain the physics FIRST, then the technical details.
2. Audience:
- Write for another 1B Physics student who has NOT seen the manual.
3. Content:
- Briefly introduce hysteresis and ferromagnetic materials.
- State the aims: Investigate B-H curves, measure energy loss, check saturation behavior.
