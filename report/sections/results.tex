Results Guidance:

1. Graphs (Crucial):
- Plot Hysteresis loops ($B$ vs $H$) for Mild Steel and Transformer Iron.
- Plot loops for Cu/Ni above and below 40 deg C.
- Ensure axes are labeled (Quantity / Unit).
- Include ERROR BARS on graphs.
- Use solid data markers.
2. Quantitative Results:
- Calculate and report Power dissipated per unit volume ($P$ / $V$): Area of loop).
- Report Relative Permeability ($\mu_r$): Max, Min, and Range.
- Compare values for different materials.
3. Presentation:
- Figures must have detailed captions describing the features.
- Refer to every figure in the text.
