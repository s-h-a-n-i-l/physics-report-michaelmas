# Report Template

This directory contains a LaTeX skeleton for a physics scientific report.

- `main.tex` is the entry point; it assembles section files from `sections/`.
- Edit the individual section files inside `sections/` to add your content.
- Place figures in `figures/`, tables in `tables/`, and bibliography entries in `bib/references.bib`.
- To build the PDF (requires `latexmk`), run `./compile.sh` from inside this `report/` directory.
